How Irish men are funnier and more handsome (his words). How anyone without a vice is not to be trusted.My deep fear of turning 30<\/p>\n<p>Most awkward moment?<br \/>\nWhen Will tried to take our selfie with the camera facing the wrong way. And the knowing glances from the staff throughout the evening.<\/p>\n<p>Good table manners?<br \/>\nBetter than me! I wasn\u2019t going to try eating pan con tomate with a knife and fork, but Will did it gracefully.<\/p>\n<p>Best thing about Will?<br \/>\nAll those hobbies! Surfing, skiing, hiking.

Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com<\/p>\n<p>The free press is under attack from multiple forces. Media outlets are closing their doors, victims to a broken business model. In much of the world, journalism is morphing into propaganda, as governments dictate what can and can\u2019t be printed. In the last year alone, hundreds of reporters have been killed or imprisoned for doing their jobs. The UN reports that 85% of the world\u2019s population experienced a decline in press freedom in their country in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>As you join us today from Bangladesh we hope you will consider supporting us in our efforts to do something about this. Despite the financial challenges plaguing the media industry, we\u2019ve decided to keep our journalism paywall-free, because we believe everyone has the right to high-quality, fact-checked reporting. And we maintain our independence thanks to generosity from readers all over the world, who understand that supporting the free press is an investment in an informed and empowered public.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike many others, we have no billionaire owner \u2013 this helps us maintain the freedom to fearlessly chase the truth and report it with integrity. Your support will allow us to continue to work with trademark determination and passion to bring you journalism that\u2019s always free from commercial or political interference.<\/p>\n<p>Help power the Guardian\u2019s reporting for the years to come, whether with a small sum or a larger one. If you can, please support us on a monthly basis from just $2. It takes less than a minute to set up, and you can rest assured that you\u2019re making a big impact every single month in support of open, independent journalism.
