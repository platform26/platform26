What can I do?\u201d It was a combination of enjoying drama, theatre and public speaking, as well as spending time looking at books, that led me to train as a barrister. There are certainly lots of theatrics in court.<\/p>\n<p>Traditionally, you never wash your wig. When you start practising, your wig is shiny and white, so it\u2019s obvious that you are new to the job. Once you have become seasoned, your wig will be dull and beaten up, which oddly gets you more respect.<\/p>\n<p>Court is an inherently formal environment \u2013 and the more formal the environment, the more amusing it is when someone gets something wrong. The public should refer to a high court judge as \u201cmy lord\u201d or \u201cmy lady\u201d, but I heard one witness use \u201cmate\u201d. An elderly client referred to a very dry, middle-aged judge as \u201cyoung man\u201d, which raised a snigger in the courtroom. Another guy, for reasons I never understood, called everyone \u201cDipper\u201d. Outside the courtroom, he referred to me as Dipper. He referred to my client as Dipper. Then, in court, he referred to the judge as Dipper, which they found very irritating.<\/p>\n<p>Once, the opposing client didn\u2019t have a solicitor \u2013 which is highly unusual and not recommended \u2013 and hadn\u2019t made any contact, so we assumed they weren\u2019t going to turn up. Then the door burst open and in he came. The first thing the judge said was: \u201cYou haven\u2019t produced any evidence to support your case at all. Why shouldn\u2019t I dismiss your claim straight away?\u201d They pulled out a plastic bag, packed full of mouldy, musky-smelling documents, and emptied it all over the judge\u2019s desk. The judge went absolutely berserk.<\/p>\n<p>I haven\u2019t detected much change in people\u2019s attitudes due to the pandemic. Sadly, human nature means just as many arguments still end up in legal disputes, although a lot of hearings are now online. This also means that people have trouble dealing with technology. One court attender couldn\u2019t hear what was going on and got increasingly cross. He was effing and blinding that the system was rubbish, even though everyone in court could hear him. Suddenly, his son appeared in the background and said: \u201cDad, you\u2019ve still got your headphones plugged in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, people are far more relaxed addressing a judge on the screen at home than they would be in court. When I called one of my witnesses to appear before the judge, she appeared on the screen in her dressing gown, looking as if she was on holiday, smoking a cigarette. I sent an urgent text message: \u201cCan you please at least put on a jumper and put out your cigarette when you are giving your evidence?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In another case, a farmer lost a litigation that resulted in him having to pay thousands of pounds to a neighbour. He went to the bank, asked for the thousands he owed in 2p coins, then mixed it into a huge pile of manure, loaded it on to a tractor, drove to his neighbours\u2019 and tipped it all over their front garden. I had to admire his creativity.<\/p>\n<p>The free press is under attack from multiple forces. Media outlets are closing their doors, victims to a broken business model. In much of the world, journalism is morphing into propaganda, as governments dictate what can and can\u2019t be printed. In the last year alone, hundreds of reporters have been killed or imprisoned for doing their jobs. The UN reports that 85% of the world\u2019s population experienced a decline in press freedom in their country in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>As you join us today from Bangladesh we hope you will consider supporting us in our efforts to do something about this. Despite the financial challenges plaguing the media industry, we\u2019ve decided to keep our journalism paywall-free, because we believe everyone has the right to high-quality, fact-checked reporting. And we maintain our independence thanks to generosity from readers all over the world, who understand that supporting the free press is an investment in an informed and empowered public.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike many others, we have no billionaire owner \u2013 this helps us maintain the freedom to fearlessly chase the truth and report it with integrity. Your support will allow us to continue to work with trademark determination and passion to bring you journalism that\u2019s always free from commercial or political interference.<\/p>\n<p>Help power the Guardian\u2019s reporting for the years to come, whether with a small sum or a larger one. If you can, please support us on a monthly basis from just $2. It takes less than a minute to set up, and you can rest assured that you\u2019re making a big impact every single month in support of open, independent journalism. Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I came to the end of my degree and thought: \u201cOh my goodness, I\u2019ve got&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":19,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/platform26\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/18"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/platform26\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/platform26\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/platform26\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/platform26\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=18"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/platform26\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/18\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":20,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/platform26\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/18\/revisions\/20"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/platform26\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/19"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/platform26\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=18"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/platform26\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=18"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/platform26\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=18"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
