A first-rate cast is matched by Semyon Bychkov in the pit.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019re like a vision from old fairytales,\u201d sings the Prince to Rusalka, the doomed water-spirit heroine of Dvor\u00e1k\u2019s opera. Much in this new production by Ann Yee and Natalie Abrahami is a vision from an old opera house \u2013 in a good way. The old-fashioned feel starts with a beautifully realised aerial ballet of the Prince swimming into Rusalka\u2019s arms and continues once the lights go up with Chloe Lamford\u2019s sets, grand and opulent to match the richly textured orchestral playing that the conductor Semyon Bychkov is conjuring up in the pit.<\/p>\n<p>So far, so old-school \u2013 yet some of the visual opulence is unashamed stage trickery. For Yee and Abrahami, Rusalka is about humanity versus nature, the despoiling of natural beauty by human carelessness. Their previous work together has been ecologically conscious, and that continues here: you can be impressed by the lushness of the hanging fronds around Rusalka\u2019s lake without guessing that they are made from metres of the wardrobe department\u2019s old offcuts.<\/p>\n<p>Annemarie Woods\u2019s costumes have a dressing-up-box feel, with wood spirits covered in mossy clumps and with Alexei Isaev\u2019s Vodn\u00edk entering like Lucius Malfoy dressed by Issey Miyake. Rusalka similarly wears a translucent cape, pleated from neck to toe. But as they move and the fabric catches the last-ray-before-sunset glow of Paule Constable\u2019s lighting, we realise that they are not merely fairytale creatures emerging from the water: they are the water itself.<\/p>\n<p>This fragile beauty can\u2019t survive Rusalka\u2019s move to the Prince\u2019s palace, where she is buckled into a silver corset and everything else that\u2019s natural is covered in gold paint or imitated in inflatable plastic. When we return to the lake in act three it\u2019s not only Rusalka who has lost her innocence \u2013 the water is polluted, the wood spirits enraptured with the junk the Prince\u2019s party guests have left behind.<\/p>\n<p>Asmik Grigorian\u2019s first Rusalka in the UK doesn\u2019t disappoint: her polished-steel soprano glints and flashes. David Butt Philip is her outstanding match as the fickle Prince, his tenor soaring, and the rest of the cast is first-rate, from Emma Bell\u2019s imperious yet flirty Duchess \u2013 almost the scrubbed-up twin of Sarah Connolly\u2019s worldly-wise Je\u017eibaba \u2013 to the comic pair of Ross Ramgobin and Hongni Wu as the forester and his nephew. All are supported at every turn by Bychkov\u2019s wonderfully elastic and idiomatic-sounding orchestra. Yee and Abrahami may have transformed rags into riches on stage but it\u2019s in the pit that the magic of this Rusalka really happens.<\/p>\n<p>The free press is under attack from multiple forces. Media outlets are closing their doors, victims to a broken business model. In much of the world, journalism is morphing into propaganda, as governments dictate what can and can\u2019t be printed. In the last year alone, hundreds of reporters have been killed or imprisoned for doing their jobs. The UN reports that 85% of the world\u2019s population experienced a decline in press freedom in their country in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>As you join us today from Bangladesh we hope you will consider supporting us in our efforts to do something about this. Despite the financial challenges plaguing the media industry, we\u2019ve decided to keep our journalism paywall-free, because we believe everyone has the right to high-quality, fact-checked reporting. And we maintain our independence thanks to generosity from readers all over the world, who understand that supporting the free press is an investment in an informed and empowered public.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike many others, we have no billionaire owner \u2013 this helps us maintain the freedom to fearlessly chase the truth and report it with integrity. Your support will allow us to continue to work with trademark determination and passion to bring you journalism that\u2019s always free from commercial or political interference.<\/p>\n<p>Help power the Guardian\u2019s reporting for the years to come, whether with a small sum or a larger one.
